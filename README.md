# testFilesCreate

This repository is no longer actively maintained on GitHub. The current version is a Bash script maintained in Codeberg, a free community alternative to GitHub. [testFilesCreate - Bash script, Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Jim-JMCD/testFileCreate)   

#### This repository only contains X86-64 excutable.  For the ARM version go to [testFilesCreate_for_ARM_aarch64](https://github.com/Jim-JMCD/testFilesCreate_for_ARM_aarch64)


 A small Linux app that creates test files filling them with random data in a single directory or a directory tree. 
 
 * Includes a calculator for creating data in directory trees. [ Option -C ]
 * Will create a single file to directory trees of files, minimum file size = 2 bytes   
 * Files can be identical or individually filled with random content.
 * File contents can either be printable or binary. All contents generated from /dev/urandom.
 * Selecting the printable pool of characters determines the **compressibility** of file contents.  
 * Files sizes can be identical or randomly sized within a given range.
 * Run either interactively or unaccompanied in batch mode.

See __Comaparitive benchmark testing of data compression and deduplication__ section on how testFileCreate can be used as a standardised benchmark for comparing data storage reduction techniques. 
 
_______________________________________________________________________
testFilesCreate is a Linux portable x64 executable created from the bash script [tFile_Create](https://github.com/Jim-JMCD/Test_Files_Create) (private Github repository) using shc.

### Dependency
This requires a Linux bash environment to run. Will run in Microsoft WSL2(Linux), TestFilesCreate will not run in MSYS2, Gitbash and Cygwin environmants

An executable created from the *shc* utility. More : [Github shc](https://github.com/neurobin/shc)

## CALCULATOR mode 

__testFileCreate -C__ 
 
 *User Inputs*: Tree depth, width, number files per directory and file size
 
 *Output*: Summary, tables of data trees of current and smaller trees. Tables contain data size and file numbers for each tree
_______________________________________________________________________
## TEST DATA CREATION mode  

__DEFAULTS__
 * File contents are binary. Use -P or -D for creating compressable printable data  
 * If all files same size then contents will also be identical.  Use -r option to randomise file contents.
 * A time stamped output directory is created in users current directory. Alternatively use another directory with the -o option
 * Interactive mode, requires confirmation to proceed after providing user with a summary. See examples.

 Maximum permitted values, see __Limitations__ section    

__OPTIONS :__ 

___Directory Layout___ _All mandatory_

For the following, _n_ is a number, minimum is 1   
* -n _n_   Number of files in each directory.
* -d _n_   Depth. How many directories deep.  
* -w _n_   Width. How many directories wide.  

Create single directory: -d 1 (-w if set, will be ignored) 

Create tree of directories: 
* Depth min is -d 2
* Width min is -w 1 and manditory  

___File Size___ _A file size is mandatory_

*Fixed File Size*
 * File sizes have to be designated by B, K, M or G. Minimum is 2B (2 bytes). Example 2KiB = 2K, 3MiB = 3M 4GiB = 4G   
 * -f Fixed file size, default [usage: -f 2K]

 _NOTE: Default content for fixed file size of printable data is:_ ALL FILES ARE IDENTICAL, use     
 * -r Random content is generated individually for every file.   

_Random File Size_
* All files individually filled with random content. 
* -s Smallest file size.
* -l Largest file size. 
* If -s is omitted, the random range starts at 2B (2 bytes) if largest file size is <1G, smallest size will be 1M (1MiB) if largest file size is >= 1G

___File Contents___ _Default is random binary_

* __-P _n___   Where _n_ is a number in the range 1 to 95. Selects the pool of printable characters from the ASCII set.
  * _n_ = 1 files only contain the uppercase 'A' 
  * _n_ = 2 to 26 files only contain lowercase Latin alphabet characters
  * _n_ >26 files contain printable ASCII characters. Max n = 95 

* __-D _n___  Where _n_ is a number in the range 1 to 10. Selects the pool of digit charcters from the ASCII set.
  * _n_ = 1 files only contain zeros '0'
  * _n_ > 1 files contain digits. Max n = 10

* _-r_ Random content for fixed file sizes.

 __INPUT, OUTPUT and LOGGING__
 
* _-b_ Batch/quiet run with no user checks. Default is interactive with user input.  
* _-o_ Output to an _existing_ directory.
* Defaults to current working directory
* Creates a new time stamped directory for content (tfc_YYMMDD_hhmm_ss).
* No logging. In batch mode user has to redirect output to a file  
* Progress indicated by time stamping every ten directories filled with files.
* The 'script' command can be used in interactive mode to record all activty. 
 
__LIMITATIONS__

Data creation bails out before any data creation if: 
* The number of directories to be created exceeds 100 million
* The number of files to be created exceeds 100 million
* If the 'shuf' command is not available 
* if the -c option not avaiable for the 'head' command.

If the 'seq' command is not avaiable. The character pool will not be displayed in the inital summary. The seq command is not required for file creation.

Binary data is generated from /dev/urandom. This data will not compress that well. Binary data that is stored/transmitted may render data deduplication and compression ineffective.  

__FILE CONTENT VALIDATION__

___Validate contents: all Files:___

    od -N <bytes> -Ax -t x1z <file name>
     
* Where \<bytes\> is the number to check from beginning of file.
* Non-printable characters will appear as "dots"

___Validate printable character distribution:___
   
    od -a <file name>  | cut -b 9- | tr " " \\n | egrep -v "^$" | sort | uniq -c
    OR
    sed 's/\(.\)/\1\n/g' <file name> | sort | uniq -c
        
_Output_
* Column 1 : Character count
* Column 2 : Character being counted. NOTE : This column should only contain a single charcter, _if more than one character then file contents is binary data_. 

___Validate printable character pool count:___ 

Example: confirms that a complexity of 17 given by __-P 17__ contains a pool of 17 different characters. 

    od -a <file name>  | cut -b 9- | tr " " \\n | egrep -v "^$" | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
    OR
    sed 's/\(.\)/\1\n/g' <file name> | sort | uniq -c | wc -l

## Comparitive benchmark testing of data compression and deduplication
testFileCreate can be used as a standardised benchmark for comparing data storage reduction techniques. 

In these examples the __Data Complexity__ is set by the __-P option__.  A data complexity of 10 = -P 10 and a data complexity of 12 = -P 12
